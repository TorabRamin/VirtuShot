## üöÄ Deployment & Setup

This application is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, making deployment on a VPS or a service like Dockge straightforward.

### Prerequisites
-   A server/VPS with Docker and Docker Compose installed.
-   Git installed on your server.
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Log in to your server via SSH and clone the project repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtushot.git
    cd virtushot
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    The application uses an `.env` file to manage sensitive information. Copy the example file to create your own configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file with a text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and set the following variables:

    ```env
    # Your secret key from Google AI Studio
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_goes_here

    # A long, random, secret string for signing JWT tokens
    # You can generate one here: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_string_here

    # The MongoDB connection string.
    # The default value is configured to work with the docker-compose setup and should not be changed unless you are using an external database.
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://db:27017/virtushot
    ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    From the root directory of the project, run the following command. This will build the Docker images for the client and server, and start all three containers in detached mode (`-d`).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    - `--build`: Rebuilds the images if the code has changed.
    - `-d`: Runs the containers in the background.

4.  **Access Your Application**
    The application will now be running. The Nginx container is configured to listen on port `8080`. You can access it in your browser at:
    `http://<your_vps_ip_address>:8080`

### Using with Dockge

Dockge simplifies managing Docker Compose projects.
1.  After cloning the repo and setting up the `.env` file on your VPS, navigate to your Dockge UI.
2.  Click "Compose" and then "Scan Stacks Folder". Dockge should detect the `docker-compose.yml` file in your cloned repository.
3.  Alternatively, you can create a new stack, name it `virtushot`, and paste the contents of `docker-compose.yml` into the editor.
4.  Ensure the working directory for the stack points to the `virtushot` folder you cloned.
5.  Click "Up" or "Start" in the Dockge UI to deploy your application. You can now manage logs, start/stop, and update the application directly from Dockge.

### Stopping the Application
To stop the application, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
To stop the containers and also remove the database volume (deleting all data):
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
